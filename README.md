# 📊 Loan Automation in LOS - Data & Analytics Case Study

This repository presents a complete **Data/Analytics case study** evaluating the impact of automated loan issuance within the Loan Origination System (LOS).  
The project includes technical architecture, workflow mapping, SQL-based KPI calculations, event-log analytics, and BI dashboard validation.

# 🏗 1. Architecture Overview

The following diagram illustrates how LOS components, external systems, and automation services interact during the loan issuance process.

![Architecture Diagram.png](./docs/architecture.png)

**Key Components**
- **LOS UI & Backend** — handles application intake  
- **Decision Engine** — runs rule validation (LTV, PTI, score, checklist)  
- **External Systems** — bureau, registry, scoring data sources  
- **Auto Disbursement Service (ADS)** — performs instant loan disbursement  
- **Core Banking** — final posting and account updates

# 🔀 2. Automated vs Manual Workflow

Repeat-loan applications follow one of two routing paths:

### **Automated Path (STP — under 1 minute)**
- All Decision Engine rules pass  
- LOS auto-issues the loan  
- ADS executes automatic disbursement  

### **Manual Review Path (20–30% of repeat loans)**
- Triggered by missing data or failed rule checks  
- Routed to a human checker  
- Before automation: **100%** of repeat loans required manual review

# 🔁 4. Data & Analytics Pipeline

This diagram shows how operational data flows into SQL-based analytics and BI dashboards:

1. LOS generates `loan_applications` data  
2. Decision Engine produces rule results  
3. `application_events` logs timestamps  
4. SQL aggregates KPIs  
5. Dashboard visualizes performance over time

# 🧮 5. SQL Logic for KPI Measurement

## **5.1 Manual Review Rate**

```sql
WITH repeat_loans AS (
    SELECT
        application_id,
        DATE(created_timestamp) AS dt,
        is_manual_review
    FROM loan_applications
    WHERE is_repeat_loan = 1
)
SELECT
    dt,
    ROUND(
        100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN is_manual_review = 1 THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*),
        2
    ) AS manual_review_rate_pct
FROM repeat_loans
GROUP BY dt
ORDER BY dt;
```

---

## **5.2 Processing Time (Event-Based Duration)**  
Measures the time between application creation and automated issuance.  
This KPI is calculated using event logs generated by LOS.

```sql
WITH events AS (
    SELECT
        application_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN event_type = 'APP_CREATED' THEN event_timestamp END) AS created_at,
        MIN(CASE WHEN event_type = 'AUTO_ISSUED' THEN event_timestamp END) AS auto_issued_at
    FROM application_events
    GROUP BY application_id
)
SELECT
    DATE(created_at) AS dt,
    ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (auto_issued_at - created_at)) / 60.0), 2)
        AS avg_auto_processing_min
FROM events
WHERE auto_issued_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY dt
ORDER BY dt;
```

## 6. KPI Results (Before vs After Automation)

Measures automation impact across core operational indicators  
using SQL calculations and BI dashboard validation.

| KPI | Before Automation | After Automation | Measurement Method |
|-----|------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Manual Review Rate (Repeat Loans)** | ~100% | **20–30%** | SQL aggregation on `is_manual_review` |
| **Processing Time** | 30–60 minutes | **< 1 minute** | Event timestamps (`APP_CREATED` → `AUTO_ISSUED`) |
| **STP Rate** | ~0% | **70–80%** | Auto-issued / total repeat loans |
| **Human Error Rate** | High | **Significantly reduced** | Exception logs and manual correction volume |

---

## **6.1 KPI Interpretation**  
Explains what the measured KPIs indicate about system performance after automation.

- Manual review dropped from **100% → 20–30%**, confirming that the majority of repeat-loan applications now follow an automated STP path.
- Processing time decreased from **30–60 minutes → under 1 minute**, validating real-time rule checks and ADS integration.
- STP rate increased to **70–80%**, demonstrating stable and scalable automation.
- Human error significantly declined due to reduced manual intervention.
- Event logs show consistent, predictable automation flow with minimal fallback scenarios.
- Customer experience improved due to instant decisioning.

---

## **7. Insights**  
Key analytical and operational takeaways drawn from KPI behavior and process observation.

- Automation meaningfully increased **operational efficiency**.
- Decision-making became **more consistent**, thanks to rule-based processing.
- Overall **processing cost decreased**, as fewer staff hours were required.
- **Customer journey improved** through immediate loan approvals.
- **Exception handling became structured and focused**, improving accuracy of manual cases.
- Automation enabled higher **throughput with the same team**, improving scalability.

## **8. Conclusion**  
Summarizes the measurable business impact of introducing automated loan issuance in LOS.

- Manual review reduced from **100% → 20–30%**.  
- Processing time improved from **30–60 minutes → under 1 minute**.  
- STP stabilized at **70–80%**, proving automation reliability.  
- Human error significantly decreased as manual workload dropped.  
- SQL + event logs + BI dashboards enabled ongoing monitoring and optimization.  
- Automation enhanced both **operational performance** and **customer experience**.

This case study demonstrates how **automation + analytics + SQL-driven measurement** can transform banking processes at scale.
